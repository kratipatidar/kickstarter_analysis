## Analysis of Kickstarter Projects
The aim of this project is to analyze the data available on projects funded through the crowd-funding website 'Kickstarter'. The code is solely based in python. The analysis is carried out for all the projects launched in the years 2019 and 2020. 

## Workflow of Project
1. Data cleaning and data manipulation
2. Analysis of project counts across different countries and project categories
3. Analysis of projects across different funding ranges and their state (i.e. whether these projects were successful or not)

## About the Code Files
'kickstarter_2019_cumulative' contains analysis of projects in solely 2019. 'kickstarter_2020' contains analysis of all projects in 2020. Additionally, a comparison between the number of new covid cases across different countries and specific project features is also contained in the code file for 2020. 'kickstarter_2019_vs_2020' consists of the comparison between project counts and other features for the years 2019 and 2020. 

The code is well documented as each step is described using comments. It is easy to follow along and make out what exactly is being done at each individual step.
